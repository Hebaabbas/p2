# Testing and problems:
i hade issues with writing my JavaScript code which i will be able to have it 100%done by the time of resubmission. I was aiming to try to make my choices of questions to be defined either right or wrong and to every right answer there will be a point counted to the user which will be able to be seen by the user when the sumbuit button is clicked. I had issues with that and there were no available times with the mentor to be booked during the weekend so i couldnt get any help with my question.

## Media
I have used google to search for the logo and the background image.
